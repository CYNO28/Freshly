<p>“Great things in a bussiness are never done by a person they’re done by a team of people”, So it was our first team project, and we learnt a lot from each other and learnt how to collaborate on a project as a team. It was a great experience working as a team and whatever small thing we made, we gave our best.<p/>

<h1>Project Details:-<h1/>

<p>We had to make a replica of the freshly.com website. Freshly is a New York-based prepared meal delivery company that delivers throughout the United States. Founded by Michael Wystrach and Carter Comstock, the company ships one million meals per week and delivers to the contiguous United States. In 2020 Freshly was acquired by Nestlé for US$1.5 billion.We have tried our best to clone the replica of the website.<p/>


Our project stands firmly on three pillars :-

<p>
HTML -(Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that allows us to structure the information that is displayed to the user.)
CSS — for Styling (Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a styling language used to describe the visual appearance of HTML elements. It can be used to controls aspects like the positioning of an element, its dimensions, text style or colors, or almost any other visual aspect of a website.)
JavaScript — for logic and interactions(It allows us to add custom behavior to your websites, such as reacting to user events, loading data from web services and showing or hiding elements on a page.)
